🚨 EMERGENCY CREDIT TRANSFER SOLUTION
Transfer credits from payment user to frontend user

PROBLEM: Credits went to wrong user due to user ID mismatch
SOLUTION: Direct database credit transfer

SAFE APPROACH:
1. Add credits to correct user (don't remove from wrong user yet)
2. Log all changes for audit trail
3. Verify transfer worked before any cleanup
