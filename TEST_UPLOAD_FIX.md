# File Upload Fix Verification Test

## Problem Summary
- **Issue**: File uploads from frontend never reached backend API
- **Root Cause**: BFF proxy incorrectly handling multipart/form-data ReadableStream
- **Fix**: Proper FormData parsing and header handling in BFF proxy

## Test Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification
- ✅ Code changes committed and pushed to `security-hardening-neon` branch
- ✅ Vercel deployment should auto-trigger from git push
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

### 2. Post-Deployment Test (Manual)

**Frontend**: https://gojob.ing
**Backend**: https://resume-matcher-backend-j06k.onrender.com

1. **Authentication Test** (should still work):
   ```
   GET https://gojob.ing/api/bff/api/v1/resumes/upload-test
   Expected: 401 Unauthorized (without auth) or 200 OK (with auth)
   ```

2. **Upload Test** (this should now work):
   - Navigate to https://gojob.ing
   - Sign in with Google (authentication should work)
   - Try to upload a PDF or DOCX file
   - Expected: File should upload successfully and redirect to `/resume/{resume_id}`

### 3. Backend Logs to Check

**Frontend logs** (Vercel Functions):
```
=== UPLOAD REQUEST DETAILS ===
Method: POST
Path: api/v1/resumes/upload
FormData entries: ["file"]
FormData file: file = filename.pdf (12345 bytes, application/pdf)
```

**Backend logs** (Render):
```
Resume upload started - request_id: xxx, user: {user_id}
Upload details - filename: filename.pdf, content_type: application/pdf
File read completed - size: 12345 bytes
Resume upload completed - resume_id: xxx
```

### 4. Expected Fix Results

✅ **BEFORE**: Upload requests never appeared in backend logs
✅ **AFTER**: Upload requests should appear in backend logs with proper file data

✅ **BEFORE**: Frontend upload hook showed network/fetch errors
✅ **AFTER**: Frontend should receive successful upload response with resume_id

✅ **BEFORE**: Users stuck on upload screen
✅ **AFTER**: Users redirected to `/resume/{resume_id}` page

## Technical Changes Made

1. **BFF Proxy Fix** (`apps/frontend/app/api/bff/[...path]/route.ts`):
   - Fixed `prepareRequestBody()` to use `req.formData()` instead of `req.body`
   - Removed content-type header for multipart uploads (let fetch set boundary)
   - Added comprehensive upload logging

2. **Stream Handling**:
   - Properly consume Next.js ReadableStream once
   - Convert to FormData for fetch() compatibility
   - Maintain file metadata through proxy

3. **Header Management**:
   - Preserve authentication headers
   - Let browser set multipart boundary automatically
   - Maintain CORS compatibility

## Critical Code Locations

- **Frontend Upload**: `apps/frontend/components/common/file-upload.tsx`
- **Upload Hook**: `apps/frontend/hooks/use-file-upload.ts` 
- **BFF Proxy**: `apps/frontend/app/api/bff/[...path]/route.ts` ⭐ **FIXED**
- **Backend Endpoint**: `apps/backend/app/api/router/v1/resume.py`

## Deployment Status

- **Git Commit**: `5dd3bbe` - "CRITICAL FIX: File upload BFF proxy - Fix FormData stream consumption"
- **Branch**: `security-hardening-neon`
- **Vercel**: Auto-deploy should trigger within 2-3 minutes
- **Status**: Monitor https://vercel.com dashboard for deployment success

**This fix addresses the core issue where ReadableStream consumption in Next.js App Router was preventing multipart/form-data uploads from reaching the backend API through the BFF proxy.**
